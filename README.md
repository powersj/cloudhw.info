Decoder ring for cloud instance hardware

## Overview

Each cloud has its own unique naming scheme for cloud instance types. Trying to remember what each sizes includes is difficult enough, not to mention the various individual letters in the names. Hence this site was born. It was also an opportunity to see what a static site generator and some  JavaScript could do.
