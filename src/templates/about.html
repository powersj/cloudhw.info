    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Each cloud has its own unique naming scheme for cloud instance types. Trying to remember what each sizes includes is difficult enough, not to mention the various individual letters in the names. Hence this site was born. It was also an opportunity to see what a static site generator and some vanilla JavaScript could do.</p>

    <h2>Site Elements</h2>
    <p>The site was built with the following tools and libraries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bulma.io/">bulma</a>: free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox (MIT License)</li>
        <li><a href="https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/">Awesomplete</a>: Ultra lightweight, customizable, simple autocomplete widget with zero dependencies, built with modern standards for modern browsers (MIT License)</li>
        <li><a href="https://jsplumbtoolkit.com/">jsplumb</a>: provides a means for a developer to visually connect elements on their web pages, using SVG, with no external dependencies (Community Edition MIT License)</li>
        <li><a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">Material Design Icons</a>: 5300+ icons allows designers and developers targeting various platforms to download icons in the format, color, and size they need for any project (SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (Community Icons) and Apache License 2.0 (Google Icons))</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prior Art</h2>
    <p>There are some other sites worth mentioning that present similar data. While most of these sites below are more focused on the cost of launching instances these sites also show information about the hardware. All of these sites, like this one, are not maintained by or affiliated with any cloud.</p>

        <li><a href="https://ec2.shop/">ec2.shop</a>: Hacker way to compare Amazon EC2 instances price</li>
        <li><a href="https://ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a>: Easy Amazon EC2 & RDS instance comparison</li>
